# Automated_feature_engineering
In this repository, I have created a project which is based on automated feature enginnering for machine leanring, where you just need to give your file path of any excel or csv file and it will apply all the feature engineering operations on that file and you will get one processed file, which you can directly use for you machine learning project.

# Feature Engineering Oprations 
1. Data Cleaning --> Handeling missing values, dealing with outliers and correcting data entry errors.

2. Data Integration --> Merging of multiple dataset in one single dataset

3. Data Transformation --> normalization and standardization log or power transformation

4. Handling Text and categorical data --> tokenization, one hot encoder, label encoding 

5. Handeling Date and Time Data --> convert date and time into numerical format
